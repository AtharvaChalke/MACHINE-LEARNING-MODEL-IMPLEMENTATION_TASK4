# Air Quality Prediction System

This Python project predicts air quality levels using sensor data,classifying whether the air is "Good" or "Bad" based on carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations and other environmental indicators.The system processes real-world air quality measurements from the UCI Air Quality Dataset,which contains sensor readings like PT08.S1(tin oxide),NMHC(non-methane hydrocarbons),NOx(nitrogen oxides) and NO2(nitrogen dioxide). The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately assess air pollution levels,helping users understand when air quality might be unsafe.

The project uses Pandas for data preprocessing,handling missing values and converting raw sensor data into a clean,structured format.Since the dataset uses commas as decimal separators,the code automatically corrects these entries to ensure proper numerical analysis.The system then classifies air quality into two categories; "Good" for CO levels below 2 ppm(parts per million) and "Bad" for higher concentrations.This binary classification simplifies interpretation while maintaining practical relevance for health and environmental monitoring.

For machine learning,the project employs a Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn, known for its robustness in handling complex datasets.The model is trained on 80% of the data,with the remaining 20% used for testing(i.e. test_size=0.2).Key performance metrics like accuracy, precision and recall are evaluated to ensure reliability.A confusion matrix provides a visual breakdown of correct and incorrect predictions,helping assess how well the model distinguishes between "Good" and "Bad" air quality. Additionally,the system includes a prediction function that allows users to input custom sensor readings and receive instant air quality assessments.

The project emphasizes usability and clarity.The code generates visualizations,such as a heatmap for the confusion matrix by making it easier to interpret results.The modular design ensures flexibility; users can adjust classification thresholds,add more sensors or experiment with different machine learning algorithms.By automating air quality assessment;this system serves as a foundation for environmental monitoring tools,helping individuals and organizations make informed decisions about pollution exposure.Whether used for research, public health or personal awareness, this project demonstrates how machine learning can transform raw sensor data into actionable insights.

For testing,the repository includes sample predictions and full model evaluation results.Users can run the provided Jupyter notebook to see the classification process step by step or deploy the trained model in applications that require real time air quality analysis.The project is designed for accessibility,requiring only basic Python libraries,making it easy to adapt for educational,environmental or industrial use cases.Future enhancements could include real-time data integration,multi-class classification for finer air quality gradations or deployment as a web service for broader accessibility.
